## Introduction 🌟

This project demonstrates a simple animation triggered by a user's double-click on an image, emulating the "Like" feature found in social media apps like Instagram. The feature involves a heart animation that scales up and fades in, then shrinks and fades out after a short duration. This provides visual feedback to users, making their interaction with the platform more engaging. 😍

## How It Works ⚙️

- **Step 1**: The page is initially loaded with an image and a hidden heart icon.
- **Step 2**: When the user double-clicks on the image, the heart icon becomes visible, scales up, and fades in.
- **Step 3**: After a brief moment, the heart icon fades out and returns to its original state, waiting for the next interaction.

### Key Features:
- **Double-click detection**: The heart icon is triggered by a double-click event on the image.
- **CSS animations**: Smooth scaling and fading transitions for a seamless user experience.
- **Visual feedback**: Engages users with a playful "Like" animation. 💘

### 2. **E-commerce Websites** 🛒
   - **Product Liking**: Online shopping platforms can integrate this feature to allow users to "like" or "favorite" a product. This helps the website track items of interest and suggest similar products.
